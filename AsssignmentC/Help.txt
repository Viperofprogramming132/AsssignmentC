When the program runs you will be placed in a room.
To move rooms use the 1-8 keys as shown on the menu.
Your goal is to find the exit to the maze which is in one of the rooms.

To create a dungeon for yourself you can use the text system.

Simply create a file called "Dungeon.txt" without the quotes

The format of the file is important it goes the room number followed by the 8 connections with a comma seperating each of them and one on the end eg

1,2,-,4,-,-,4,6,2,

The "-" represent blank doors and the others lead to the room given

The Player always starts in the first room given and always ends in the last room
